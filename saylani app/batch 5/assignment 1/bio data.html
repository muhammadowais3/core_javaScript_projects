<h1>BIO DATA</h1><hr />
<h3>Name:</h3>
<p><i>Muhammed Owais</i></p>
<h3>Father name:</h3>
<p><i>Shahid iqbal</i></p>
<h3>Qualification:</h3>
<p>Fourth year of <b>electronics engineering</b> </p>
<h3>Few words about myself:</h3>
<p>One thing which I always have been so passionate about is the subject <strong>Mathematics</strong>. But soon I realise I am not good at mathematics much but 
at solving logics. 
So I started engaging my interest at <strong>programming</strong>. My very first <b>Hello World</b> was firstly introduced to me by <strong>C language</strong>. 
after which <strong>OOP with java</strong> and few others programming languages were in a queue to found a door to my intersts. <br />Right now if I talk about <b>batch 5</b> html and CSS
don't make this course 
so special to me but <strong>JavaScript, React</strong> etc does. Because I am so <em>encapsulated</em> of the feeling of being creative, like Wow! what a unique thing I made, 
Look! when I did this what happens. These feeling goosebumps me the most. <br />Now what I believe is that, 
these programming languages would work as <b>"a stair to success"</b> for me. As The CEO of Alibaba "Jack Ma" had once said,
