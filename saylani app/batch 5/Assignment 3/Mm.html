        <p> Hi! My name is Owais. I am the person thinking of being so motivated by the fear of getting less success in my life.
            The worst thing I observe in me is the feeling of being <b>over confident</b>. This is the thing which has snatched
            almost everything where I showed this. But now where I stand is not just because I have failed so oftenly, Personaly
            what I believe failure is not failure until you accept it by your side, it is just because I have touched success so 
            time or in better words almost every time. But I couldn't get there. I have felt how the success smells by I have
            never got myself into that just because of the fact of being over confident. Now what I think is to place over confidence
            aside so ethicaly and have decided to say it.. Bye Bye. Because now I have tightened my seatbelts to the <strong>journey to success</strong>
