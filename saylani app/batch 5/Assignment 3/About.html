        <h3>MUHAMMED OWAIS</h3>
        Hi! My name is <a href="G:\theory\saylani\batch 5\Assignment 2\cv.html" target="_blank"> Owais</a>. I am the person thinking of being so motivated by the fear of getting less success in my life.
        The worst thing I observe in me is the feeling of being <b>over confident</b>. This is the thing which has snatched
        almost everything where I showed this. But now where I stand is not just because I have failed so oftenly, Personaly
        what I believe failure is not failure until you accept it by your side, it is just because I have touched success so 
        time or in better words almost every time. But I couldn't get there. I have felt how the success smells by I have
        never got myself into that just because of the fact of being over confident. Now what I think is to place over confidence
        aside so ethicaly and have decided to say it.. Bye Bye. Because now I have tightened my seatbelts to the <strong>journey to success</strong>
