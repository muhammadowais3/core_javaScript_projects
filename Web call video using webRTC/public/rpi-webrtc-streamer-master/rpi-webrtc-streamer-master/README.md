# WebRTC streamer for Raspberry PI

## General
Notice:  This is a work in progress, 

This repo's objective is providing something like Web Cam server on the most popular Raspberry PI hardware. By integrating  [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/native-code/) and Raspberry PI, we can stream the Raspberry camera feed to browser or native client which talks WebRTC.

Generally, the components of WebRTC service are classified into Signaling Server and WebRTC client. However, RWS(Rpi-WebRTC-Streamer) is built to operate on one piece of Raspberry PI hardware and includes some of Signaling Server functionality. In other words, the Browser or Client supporting WebRTC directly connects to RWS and receives WebRTC streaming service.

###  Web Front-End
In order to use WebRTC streaming function in web browser, various things are basically required. To simplify this, Web Front-End implements basic Authentication/Messaging/HTTP and WebRTC Signaling functions using Google's Firebase, and supports WebRTC streaming and other features provided by Rpi-WebRTC-Streamer (RWS) Function.

For Web Front-End, please refer to [RWS Web Front-End Repo](https://github.com/kclyu/rpi-webrtc-streamer-frontend).

### Streaming camera feed
To get the camera feed from Raspberry PI, i.e. H.264 video stream, RWS use MMAL(Multi-Media Abstraction Layer) library can be found on [ARM side libraries for interfacing to Raspberry Pi GPU](https://github.com/raspberrypi/userland). it provides lower level API to multi-media components running on Broadcom VideoCore. For  convenience,  this streamer directly integrated  [raspivid](https://github.com/raspberrypi/userland/tree/master/host_applications/linux/apps/raspicam)
with encoding parameter changing in H.264 stream and passing video frame through WebRTC native code package.

### Motion Detection
Motion Detection feature provided by Rpi-WebRTC-Streamer uses Inline Motion Vector which is generated during video encoding.  And use this to get the approximate Motion Detection function while using minimal CPU resources.

Please refer to [README_motion document](../master/README_motion.md).

### Messenger Notification 
The motion detection event message can be transmitted to the user through the telegram messenger. It can send motion detection message and detected video clip to Telegram Messenger client so that it can be used as a private security bot.
For more information, Please refer to [README_TelegramBot document](../master/README_TelegramBot.md).

###  WebRTC H.264 Codec supported browsers

|Browser|Supported|H.264 Codec Status|
|----------------|---------------|-----------|
|Chrome |Yes|Software encoder/decoder|
|Opera |Yes|Software encoder/decoder|
|Firefox|Yes|Browser plugin|
|Safari|Yes<sup>*note 1*</sup>||

*note 1: MacOS/Safari need 'WebRTC/Enable Legacy WebRTC API' enabled*
## Hardware Requirement
### Raspberry PI 
- Raspberry PI 2/3
- Raspberry Pi Zero/Zero W (ZeroW tested)

### Video Camera
- RPI Camera board V1/V2
